"""Answer-type enforcement (Phase 7, Part D).

Format-shaping ONLY. We shape an already-grounded answer to fit its answer_type
(select/dropdown → an allowed option; yes/no left as the model grounded it). This
can NEVER weaken grounding: it only runs on ANSWERED results, never fabricates a
"Yes"/option the answer didn't support, and never flips a NEEDS_REVIEW (unsupported)
item into an answer. If a grounded answer can't be mapped to an allowed option, it
is left as-is for the human rather than forced.
